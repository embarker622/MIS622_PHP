You can take your job and shove it in your nether regions. Not that I want to 
picture your nether regions. Eww! Though perhaps you are proud of them. They
are quite large.

This job reminds me of Christmas. I do all the work, and a fat man in 
a suit gets all the credit. 

You play solitaire all day. You make me work weekends. Without pay. You 
go to expensive "conferences" in the Bahamas. I am not allowed to 
buy a new desk lamp.

Why has most of your IT staff left over the past year? Because we all hate 
you. There are many jobs out there. The brain drain will continue.
